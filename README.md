# Reponsive Pokédex React.js Project

## Introduction
- I created this project to practice my skills with React.js, React Redux and CSS Grid Layout
- The visuals of the Pokédex was designed purely with HTML elements styled with CSS (including layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox) - so doesn't use any SVG images
- New Pokémon can be selected using the directional buttons on the D-Pad, which fetches the required data from the PokéAPI
