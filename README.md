# 🔴 React Pokédex Project ⚪

## 🎮 Live Demo
https://sandesh-rai.github.io/pokedex/

## 📄 Introduction
- I created this project to apply my front-end knowledge with React.js, React Redux and CSS Grid
- The look of the Pokédex was achieved without using any SVGs where:
    - Individual HTML elements were styled with pure CSS
    - Responsive element layout was achieved using CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox and CSS Positioning
- The PokéAPI (RESTful Pokémon API) is used to retrieve data, and React Redux is used for state management
- New Pokémon can be selected with user input via the directional-pad or text box
